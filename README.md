# 🛒 BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 👋 Quick Overview

This project is a detailed **Grocery and Retail Sales Dashboard** built to analyze the performance of the BlinkIT business. I put this together to help quickly track sales, understand product popularity, and see which store types are generating the most revenue.

The goal is simple: **Turn raw sales data into smart, easy-to-digest business decisions.**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project leverages the power of familiar spreadsheet and data visualization tools.

* **Microsoft Excel (.xlsb):** The original source for data and dashboard creation (based on the exported CSVs). This is where the core dashboard lives.
* **CSV Files:** Used as data outputs for the core data (`BlinkIT Grocery Data.csv`) and the calculated metrics/design elements (`Sheets Design.csv`).
